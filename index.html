   <Introduction>
     <p>
       Yes if you are reading this article you might be thinking that "what the heck! has this person gone mad?" but  cases have started rising and
       if we allow school to reopen then all the effort that we are putting to stop this virus will go to waste because if the children get covid
       then their family members will get covid and so on. I will tell you about the delta variant how it is much more contagious , children needing
       to stay home and people getting vacination.
     </p>
   </Introduction>
   <thedeltavariant> 
     <h2>The Delta variant</h2>
     <img src="deltavariantimage.jpg" alt="delta variant image" width=600 heigth=300>
     <p> 
     The delta variant is a lot more transible that the origninal COVID-19 and many other deseases which are the common cold and influenza,
     as well as the viruses that cause smallpox, MERS, SARS, and Ebola.The delta variant was identified in India in December it swept through
     the region and went to Great Britian before coming to the United States. The cases started to rise again in low vacianation places and 
     also in high vacination places. The CDC (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) released data in july that even the <b>vacinated</b> 
     people can spread the delta variant and this was the middle of the vacation season where people were going to beaches and other place 
     and it made the delta variant spread more easily. But the <b>vacinated</b> people do not get sick of the delta variant it just goes away. 
     The <b>unvacinated</b> people though are in a lot of trouble because the delta variant can easily kill them and only 189.9 million people 
     or <b>57% of the US population have atleast one dose</b> and 163.9 million people  or <b>49% of the population have been fully vacinated</b>.
     So if we have to open the schools and wish that the pandemic will go away don't just sit and moan that you want it over, get your 
     vacination right now there are many places walmart is offering free vacination and many stores pharmacies are already equiped with the 
     vacination get one now to protect your children and your relatives.

     <h2>Children Need to stay home</h2>
     <img src="childreninhome.jpg" alt="children in a home" width=1000>
     <p>
     The children need to stay home if they do not have the vacination because if one member of the family of a child has covid that child can 
     spread it to countless others. The schools tell you that they will keep the students 6 feet apart but how do know the children will follow 
     these rules. Check California whose school opened on August 9th there is already 23 cases in only one week and if it goes on by the end of 
     this year it will be 1000 per week but i want to say if a FDA official is reading this or a fizer scientist please quickly make the vacine 
     for ages 12 and under the children are the future and if they die then our future is gone.

     <h2>People getting vacinated</h2>
     <p>
       Even after reading this you still want to send your child to school. Well then there is a way to protect your child by getting your vaccine 
       and telling people you know to get their vaccine. If you have a major youtube channel make a video of asking people to get vacinate. We need 
       to get the majority of the population vacinated to achive herd imunity. Go to the more page to see where you can get you vaccine and here is 
       a song to get you exited to get vaccinated. If the video does not work here is the link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-Bk7JP7kUY&t=5s">Song</a>
